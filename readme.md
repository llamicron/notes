# Luke's Notes
This is a repository of Luke's notes. They may be incomplete, wrong, or missing; use them at your own risk.

You can view all the notes at [this website](https://llamicron.github.io/notes). Select the class you want and it will pull all the notes from this repo. You can hit "preview" to view the first page of the notes, or "download" to download the full pdf. 

There may also be markdown files (`.md` extension) in the notes, which are best viewed in the Github file browser. Just hit "preview".

For any class that may require code as a homework submission or as notes, I'll make a separate repo for that class. For example, there are lecture notes for CSE 2312 in this repository, but all the code I wrote for the class and some code I took as notes exists in [llamicron/cse2312](https://github.com/llamicron/cse2312)
